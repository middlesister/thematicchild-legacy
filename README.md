A Thematic Legacy Child Theme
=====================

A child theme used to test the legacy mode of the Thematic theme

This child theme is created to test the legacy xhtml mode of the [Thematic theme](https://github.com/ThematicTheme/Thematic/). The legacy mode provides backwards compatibility for themes that are not yet ready to move to html5 markup for whatever reason. 

The theme is not intended for production use on a website, but used as a tool to ensure the Thematic theme works as it should. Feel free to use the code if it helps you, though I encourage you to update and make the move to html5 markup instead.

If you have any questions regarding this theme or the parent theme Thematic, ask them in the [support forums](http://thematictheme.com/forums/).
